## Description

The challenge for this particular assignment was to take a fully functional RESTful API and convert it to a completely functional GRAPHQL API built with Apolo servers and a Mongo database and React front end with Node Modules making it now a complete MERN app. This actually was quite a challenge because plenty of the code 
could stay and it was necessary to decide what to remove and how to replace it. I think doing it this way scanning all pages really helped to understand the flow 
and how the front end and back end merge together to work. It also shows a just how much work goes in to the process of meshing programs and technologies. Such as problems with compatability with software versions that did not work together or also some versions that were just too new i.e Node 17 not working with webpak 4
requiring either a patch or a downgrade to node 16 a safer more reliable version. This was a challenging but also rewarding assignment.

## Installation
Please install the required elements found in the three distinct package.json files. One can be found in client, server and also at the root of the project.
After installation you can run develop while in production mode the front end and back in will both start with this due to the use of concurrently

## Credits
This project had a ton of bugs not just from my own errors but quite a few in the dependency with the provided starter code. I was only able to solve these issues with the help of my instructor John and also Armenuhi.
